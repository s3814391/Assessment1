        <img src="mybike.jpg" alt="my bike"style="width:200px;height:300px;">
        <p>My name is Xiaoyu Xie, I’m have a part time job as a salesperson for Smartuser and also an Information system student for RMIT. I love motorcycles, is so different compare with other types of the vehicles, it feels freedoms once your set on those bikes and driving in with your souls. I only have my bikes for half a year, but I just love it so much. But I give up these hobbies after I meet my girlfriend, because you must accept that there have so much unstable situations on the road.  </p>
        <h3>Interest in IT</h3>
        <img src="work.jpg" alt="work"style="width:500px;height:400px;">
        <p>I used to study IT for a diploma, when I choose IT, I thought IT is a job that have a high income, but when I first step into the game, it changes me a lot, IT is not just coding, it also can improve logical thinking. It changes the way I introduce products for my part-time job. I also create a shortcut for recording my schedule and calculating my wages and bonus through the apple app using IT logic.</p>
        <p> I chose RMIT because it is my favorite university of all time. I plan to apply to RMIT since high school. </p>
        <p>During the study I expect to learn more knowledge for IT for example a mini-game that was created by me and I want to upload it to steam, Because I used to create CSGO skins on steam a long time ago, I also want to create other apps to make our life more convenience.</p>
        <h3>Ideal Job: </h3>
        <p>My ideal job is <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56406717?type=standout#sol=f96395d857a3c42365414a2198263bfd2d7c7a03">Date analyst</a>, I’m good at designing databases and SQL skills because my major is Information systems. This job is a junior-level doesn’t require a long time of experience suitable for a university student like me. It required SQL, R, and Python language, which is in my area, I also have 4 years of part-time job experience including one year of a salesperson I also help the management team for creating a database for the weekly report, so after I was graduated, I will find those kinds of the job in the future. So firstly, I will find an internships job during my university time. To improve my overall data analyst skills, because I never have had a similar job before it can be hard at the beginning, but after the internships, it will give me a basic idea and make me easier for find a job in the future. </p>
        <h3>Personal Profile:</h3>
        <img src="personal1.png" alt="first result"style="width:400px;height:300px;text-align:center">
        <img src="personal2.png" alt="second result"style="width:400px;height:300px;text-align:center">
        <img src="personal3.png" alt="third result"style="width:400px;height:300px;text-align:center">
        <p>From the result, I think the test result matches me a lot. I’m an extroverted, observant, judging, turbulent person, I always make new friends, I usually talk a lot. I am also observant more than the intuitive, every decision I made have a reason, I rarely make decision pends on intuition. I always judge what’s happened around me, even sometimes I say something that’s hurt my friend’s feelings. I have a visual learning style. I can remember new friends' faces first than their names. also, any knowledge that I was repeating the same step can make me remember it quicker, that’s also one of the reasons why I was choosing IT. The job discoveries also show I am good at IT jobs, which pends on my personality. </p>
        <p>My behavior will have some effect on working in a team. I can integrate into a group very easily, but I may judge other people’s work or decisions inadvertently which may affect teamwork. So, during the teamwork, I will be more careful about my decisions or speech for reducing team conflict. For forming a team, the people who more making decisions pends on their experience will work better for me, because I’m rarely making decisions pends on intuition.  </p>
        <h3>Project Idea:</h3>
        <h4>Introduction:</h4>
        <p>My idea is to create a mobile app that can allow customers to record their shift, automatically calculate the wages, and any other situation like bonuses, penalties. Customers can custom the rules of how they get paid is the customer have any bonus today? How many bonuses are given when customers have more than how many leads. How many schedulers rates customers have? Does it affect the bonus?  Or the company can sign up for their company and set up their own rules. So, when the employees got paid, they know how much exactly they got paid. </p>
        <h4>Motivation:</h4>
        <p>During my part-time job, I notice there have some apps that can allow the company gives shifts to the employees, but no apps where you can record your shifts and calculate the wages or bonus at the same time. I think for the job that got paid hourly, is very easy to calculate wages. There is also a huge amount of market for those kinds of apps. Lots of retail businesses, like supermarkets, restaurants, even this app just cooperating with a big company like Coles, WWS there is also a huge amount of the market for this app.  </p>
        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>For these Apps, there have two main ways of features. Customers can set up their own job situations, customer can mark their own shifts, get notifications when the shifts are coming, set up their own rules of how they got paid, like wages bonus. suitable for the employees whose company is not joining our app. Another way is customers can join the organization that their company already set up the rules, the company can give the shifts to employees and the wages are calculated automatically.
        So how does it work? The app should have an online database to store the data like the hourly rate for each employee, shifts, and other information. The company can enter the data themselves or the customer can enter their own situations. The company can set up the wage rules in the app, for example in my job if your meet the requirement of daily target you will get a bonus and your final bonus will time your schedule rates. So, in our app we can have a similar rule after the employee got their shifts, the app can calculate how much time the employee works for that day, and does the job have a non-paid lunch break?  If yes, the system can minus the lunch break time. Does the job have a double-paid weekend? If yes, the hourly rate will be double, or other numbers. Is there any leave? Or paid leave? How many bonuses do employees get? The company can set up those kinds of settings in the system and employees’ wages can calculate automatically. 
        With this app, the company can be easier to set up the wages for each of the customers, especially for the company have high amounts of employees. It can make the wages more automated and clearer for the employees let them know how each item affects the wages. </p>
        <h4>Tools and Technologies:</h4>
        <p>The software hardware that the app required will be the main servers or store the user data. It will use java for coding, an online database to store the user data. The app is a mobile app so it will require a mobile phone for the customer to use it. We probably are using some features that have already been made on Github, like the calendars. We can also use desktop versions for the company to make them easier to manage the wages system.  </p>
        <h4>Skills Required:</h4>
        <p>The skills that are required in my project idea were SQL, java, python, database design, Servers management skills internet security skills, and business skills. It required java, python skills for coding the app.  SQL skills for request update the data from the online database, servers’ management skill for dealing every server issues. Internet security skills for keeping all the data safe avoid internet attacks for losing customer data or disclosing customer personal information.  </p>
        <h4>Outcome:</h4>
        <p>If the project is successful, these apps will make huge changes to the employees and companies. This app is more like a tool to make wages much easier to calculate and employees can also know how they got paid. For some of the companies like Coles, Wws it will make the wages of all their employees calculated automatically and save more labor cost for manually calculating the wages.  </p>
